# Warriors Cat Name Generator
### Create funny cat names that resemble the cats in the Warriors books series by Erin Hunter.

My 11 year-old daughter has been reading the Warriors books by Erin Hunter. When she tells me about what's happening in her books, we joke about the funny names and came up with an idea of creating a website to make up new names for the different ranks of cats - Kit, Apprentice, Warrior, and Leader. 
Together we created this simple website to create fun names.
